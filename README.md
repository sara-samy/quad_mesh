# Quad mesh planarization with libigl

## Compile

Compile this project using the standard cmake routine:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

This should find and build the dependencies and create a `quad_mesh` binary.

## Run

From within the `build` directory just issue:

    ./quad_mesh

Polyscope viewer should launch displaying quad meshes.
